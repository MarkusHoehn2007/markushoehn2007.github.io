                    <h2>MATH 350 - Mathematical Scholars Calculus 3</h2>
                    <p>A continuation in the sequence of courses focused on Calculus. Provides the first semester of an integrated approach to linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations with specific topics including vector spaces, linear transformations, solutions to matrix equations, dimension, rank, eigenvalues, inner products, Sylvester’s Theorem, multi-linear algebra, vector valued functions, vector fields and general ordinary differential equations.</p>

                    <h2>MATH 351 - Mathematical Scholars Calculus 4</h2>
                    <p>A continuation in the sequence of courses focused on Calculus. Provides the second semester of an integrated approach to linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations. Students will apply knowledge from one variable calculus and linear algebra to the higher dimensional setting, but many computations will take place in the low 2 and 3 variable cases. Topics include linear ordinary differential equations, Picard’s Theorem, limits and continuity in many variables, partial derivatives, optimization problems, integration of functions of several variables, Fubini’s Theorem, integration of differential forms and Generalized Stokes’ Theorem.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>MATH 633 - Advanced Calculus I</h2>
                    <p>Analysis of functions of one variable; limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann-Stieltjes integral, sequences, series, power series, improper integrals.

                    <h2>CIS 300 - Data and Program Structures</h2>
                    <p>A study of common data and program structures together with associated algorithms. Topics include interfaces, design patterns, arrays, stacks, queues, lists, trees, hash tables, recursion, binary search, and tree traversals. Experience with both use and implementation of these structures and algorithms using a modern programming language. Discussion of tradeoffs involving performance and software maintainability.</p>
